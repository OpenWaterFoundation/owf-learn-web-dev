## Introduction ##

Web development in general refers to technologies that leverage the internet and related
technology standards to implement solutions.
The end result can be simple or complex and involve multiple components, for example:

* Web application that runs in a web browser on desktop computer or mobile device.
* An "app" that runs on a mobile device.
* Web server component such as web services that performs tasks and provides access to data.
* Use of cloud services infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, etc.
* Use of specific cloud services and "software as a service", such as hosted web maps and data visualization.

The spectrum of web application implementation ranges from simple applications that are easy to develop...
to complex systems that involve multiple components and technologies.
As with anything, a specific web application may be easily developed within the standard features of involved
technology solutions, or it may require development and sophistication outside of the common defaults.
Sometimes the last 5% of a solution can prove to be complicated and daunting and may
negatively impact functionality or usability of the software.

Unfortunately, many tutorials and examples focus on simple cases, which often fall short of reality.
This documentation will be updated over time to memorialize the Open Water Foundation's experience
dealing with non-trivial cases.

## Next Steps ##

The next steps involve selecting a technology framework and programming language(s) for web development,
and working within a development environment to be productive with the framework.
The web development framework will utilize common web technologies and standards such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;
however, the choice of a framework, language, and development environment will greatly impact everything else.

If a framework and language(s) have already been selected, refer to specific topics of interest.
