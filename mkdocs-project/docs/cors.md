# Learn Web Development / CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested
from another domain outside from which the resource was served.
For example, a web page that displays data may request the data from another server/URL.
CORS defines a way to ensure the safety of using the remote resources.
Overcoming CORS issues can be confusing and maddening.
